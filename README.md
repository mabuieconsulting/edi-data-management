# EDI Data Management
A plan and project to establish a framework for standardized master data management plans to assist in collecting all data needed to efficiently and effectively onboard EDI trading partners onto any trading network.

**Why this topic?** 

EDI Trading Partner Onboarding includes not just project management and task completion by following a standardized template for agile and waterfall project management methods, it also involves the collection of a massive amount of data that can be categorized across every domain in a master data set.  That is why it is best to consider a EDI Master Data Management plan to catalog and categorize off of the necessary data needed to complete a full EDI trading partner onboarding.  The information that needs to be collected falls all across the different areas of management, including onboarding and also transformations, transactions, integrations, interchanges, documentation, and possibly there areas.  

**Why this project?**

This project aims to takes these areas of EDI management and look at them as different data domains to help classify and group the different data needed to be collected during onboarding.  This should suffice to not only capture the different data that are needed when configuring a trading partner from end to end, but it should also record and store all of this information in an accessible manner so that it because part of the EDI MDM, which will later enable any organization to reach further into the exploration of EDI-related data in BI and other data analytics
